# HumanActivityPrediction

In this project, Extrasensory dataset was used to predict human activity. The data set was split into training, test and validation sets. The test set was improved and several models were tested and hyperparameters were tuned to compare accuracy.
It was eventually concluded that Logistic Regression Model with a C parameter of 1 was the best performing model. Other metrics such as balanced accuracy, f1 score, precision, recall and roc-auc score.
